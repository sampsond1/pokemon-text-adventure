# Pokémon Text Adventure
When starting to use GitHub in 2025, I found that I had published an old project from my senior year of high school, which I had forgotten about. I debated keeping it on here, but I remembered the project so
fondly that I thought I might as well. This is an engine for a remake of Pokémon Red/Blue as an old-style text adventure. It has a pretty dang accurate battle simulator, all 151 Pokémon with unique stats and moves,
and a functional game loop. It is incomplete as it only has the first few locations and events, and looking back there are a LOT of things that I could have done much better, but I am very proud of what I did as 
an 18-year-old!

## Features
- Pokémon Red/Blue: Now with less graphics!
- All 151 Pokémon with unique stats and moves
- Almost completely accurate Pokémon battling
- A working Save/Load system
- Does it compile after 4+ years? Who knows!

## Skills Used
- Object Oriented Programming in C#
- File reading/writing
- A whole lot of Console.WriteLine()
